## Quick Diagnostics

Before diving into specific issues, try these quick checks:

### 1. Test All Connections
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Use **Test GitHub Connection** button
3. Use **Test Slack Connection** button (if configured)
4. Check for any error messages

### 2. Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for error messages (red text)
4. Note any errors when performing actions

### 3. Verify Configuration
1. Ensure all required fields are filled in Settings
2. Check that tokens haven't expired
3. Verify repository exists and is accessible

## Configuration Issues

### "Configuration not saved" or Settings reset

**Symptoms:**
- Settings don't persist after refresh
- Configuration keeps reverting to defaults
- Can't save changes

**Causes & Solutions:**

**Browser Storage Issues:**
1. Check if browser has sufficient storage space
2. Try private/incognito mode to test
3. Clear browser data for the site and reconfigure
4. Check if browser extensions are blocking localStorage

**Configuration Corruption:**
1. Go to Settings â†’ **Reset to Defaults**
2. Reconfigure from scratch
3. Export/import settings to backup known good config

**Browser Security Settings:**
1. Ensure site isn't in blocked cookies list
2. Check if localStorage is disabled in browser settings
3. Temporarily disable strict privacy extensions

### "Validation errors" when saving

**Common validation messages and fixes:**

**"GitHub repository owner is required"**
- Fill in the GitHub username or organization name
- Example: `facebook`, `microsoft`, `your-username`

**"GitHub Personal Access Token is required"**
- Create token at [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Ensure token starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`

**"Priority labels are required"**
- Configure all three priority levels in Labels section
- Use simple names like `high`, `medium`, `low`

## GitHub Integration Problems

### "Repository not found" or 404 errors

**Check Repository Path:**
1. Verify owner/repo spelling (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure repository exists and isn't deleted
3. Try accessing `https://github.com/owner/repo` directly

**Permission Issues:**
1. Check if repository is private and token has access
2. For organization repos, ensure token has `read:org` scope
3. Try with a public repository first to isolate the issue

**Token Problems:**
1. Regenerate GitHub token with proper scopes
2. Ensure token hasn't expired
3. Use "repo" scope for private repos, "public_repo" for public

### "Authentication failed" or 401 errors

**Token Validation:**
1. Verify token format starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`
2. Check token hasn't been regenerated in GitHub
3. Ensure no extra spaces when copying token

**Token Scopes:**
Required scopes depend on repository type:
- **Public repos**: `public_repo`
- **Private repos**: `repo`
- **Organization repos**: Add `read:org`

**Test Token Manually:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

### "Rate limit exceeded" or 403 errors

**Immediate Solutions:**
1. Wait for rate limit to reset (check error message for time)
2. Reduce batch size in workflow settings
3. Avoid rapid successive searches

**Long-term Solutions:**
1. Use organization tokens which have higher limits
2. Implement search query caching
3. Space out grooming sessions across time

**Rate Limit Details:**
- **Authenticated**: 5000 requests/hour
- **Search API**: 30 requests/minute
- **Unauthenticated**: 60 requests/hour (much lower)

## Search and Loading Issues

### "No issues found" with valid search

**Common Causes:**

**All Issues Already Groomed:**
1. Check if workflow settings exclude groomed issues
2. Try setting "Exclude Groomed Issues" to false temporarily
3. Use simpler search like `is:open is:issue`

**Search Query Too Restrictive:**
1. Start with basic query: `is:open is:issue`
2. Add filters gradually: `is:open is:issue label:bug`
3. Check GitHub search syntax is correct

**Repository Has No Issues:**
1. Verify repository actually has open issues
2. Check if issues are all closed or converted to discussions
3. Try searching closed issues: `is:closed is:issue`

### Search results seem wrong or incomplete

**Exclusion Filters:**
Git Issue Flow automatically excludes certain issues based on your configuration:

1. **Priority Labels**: If "Exclude Prioritized" is enabled
2. **Groomed Labels**: If "Exclude Groomed" is enabled  
3. **Dependency Labels**: If "Exclude Dependencies" is enabled

**To see all issues:**
1. Temporarily disable all exclusions in Workflow settings
2. Use the Health tab to see full issue metrics
3. Check individual label configurations

**GitHub Search Limitations:**
1. GitHub indexes search with delays (new issues may not appear immediately)
2. Search results are limited to 1000 issues maximum
3. Complex queries may timeout

### Issues won't load or app shows loading forever

**Network Issues:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check if GitHub is down: [status.github.com](https://status.github.com)

**Browser Issues:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache for the site
3. Try different browser

**Configuration Issues:**
1. Test GitHub connection in Settings
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Verify token permissions and repository access

## Slack Integration Problems

### "Slack proxy is not running"

**Start the Proxy:**
1. Open terminal in project directory
2. Run: `node slack-proxy.cjs`  
3. Should see: "Slack proxy server running on http://localhost:3001"

**Proxy Issues:**
1. Check if port 3001 is already in use
2. Kill other processes using port 3001
3. Try different port by modifying slack-proxy.cjs

**Firewall/Network:**
1. Check if localhost connections are blocked
2. Temporarily disable firewall to test
3. Ensure no corporate proxy is interfering

### "Invalid Slack bot token" or authentication errors

**Token Validation:**
1. Ensure token starts with `xoxb-`
2. Check token hasn't been regenerated in Slack app settings
3. Copy token carefully (no spaces or truncation)

**Bot Permissions:**
Required OAuth scopes:
- `channels:history` - View messages in public channels
- `channels:read` - View basic channel information
- `users:read` - View user information

**Reinstall if Scopes Changed:**
1. Go to Slack app settings
2. Click "Reinstall App" if you added scopes
3. Get new bot token after reinstallation

### Slack thread previews not working

**Channel Access:**
1. Bot must be invited to channels with relevant threads
2. Use `/invite @BotName` in each channel
3. For private channels, explicitly invite the bot

**Thread Detection:**
1. Hover over Slack links in GitHub issues
2. Links must be to actual threads (multiple messages)
3. Single message links won't show thread previews

**URL Format Issues:**
Supported formats:
- `https://workspace.slack.com/archives/CHANNEL/pTIMESTAMP`
- Permalink URLs from Slack app

Unsupported:
- Deep links from mobile app
- Workspace URLs without specific message

### "Bot can't access channel" errors

**Invite Bot to Channel:**
```
/invite @YourBotName
```

**Check Bot Status:**
1. Go to channel member list
2. Verify bot appears in members
3. Check bot has appropriate permissions

**Private Channel Access:**
1. Private channels require explicit invitation
2. Bot won't see messages in uninvited private channels
3. Consider using public channels for threads you want to preview

## Performance Issues

### App is slow or unresponsive

**Large Issue Sets:**
1. Reduce batch size in workflow settings (try 10-20)
2. Use more specific search queries
3. Exclude more labels to reduce result size

**Browser Resources:**
1. Close other tabs using memory
2. Restart browser to clear memory
3. Check if browser extensions are impacting performance

**API Performance:**
1. GitHub API can be slow during peak times
2. Large repositories take longer to search
3. Complex search queries increase response time

### Slack previews are slow to load

**Thread Size:**
1. Large threads (100+ messages) take time to load
2. Threads with many files/attachments are slower
3. Old threads may have slower API responses

**Network Factors:**
1. Slack API performance varies by region
2. Corporate networks may add latency
3. Concurrent requests can slow responses

**Optimization:**
1. Limit thread history in queries
2. Cache frequently accessed threads
3. Avoid hovering rapidly over multiple links

## Browser and Local Issues

### Page won't load or shows blank screen

**Browser Compatibility:**
Git Issue Flow requires modern browser features:
- **Chrome**: Version 90+
- **Firefox**: Version 88+
- **Safari**: Version 14+
- **Edge**: Version 90+

**JavaScript Errors:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Disable browser extensions temporarily

**Local Development:**
1. Ensure `npm run dev` is running
2. Check if port 5173 is accessible
3. Try accessing `http://localhost:5173` directly

### Settings or data not persisting

**localStorage Issues:**
1. Check if browser allows localStorage for the site
2. Try private/incognito mode
3. Clear site data and reconfigure

**Browser Storage Limits:**
1. Check available storage space
2. Clear other site data to free space
3. Export configuration before clearing data

**Sync Issues:**
1. Settings are stored locally per browser
2. Different browsers/devices have separate configs
3. Use export/import to transfer settings

### Keyboard shortcuts not working

**Focus Issues:**
1. Click in the main app area first
2. Ensure no input fields are focused
3. Some shortcuts require specific context

**Browser Conflicts:**
1. Check if browser extensions intercept shortcuts
2. Try shortcuts in private/incognito mode
3. Some corporate software blocks certain key combinations

**Operating System:**
- Windows/Linux: Use `Ctrl+` shortcuts
- Mac: Use `Cmd+` shortcuts (some use `Ctrl+` as specified)
